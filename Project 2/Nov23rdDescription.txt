We plan to use the Student dataset consisting of information for students who attend two different schools in a certain area.
Given 33 columns of information, we have a good deal to work from so the first step is to analyze what data will look best to compare to each other.
    For example: Like in Project one, comparing how many absences the two schools have on average, using family quantifiers to analyze how students are doing in school(>3 people in a family...etc), and what the type of jobs the parents have in common with the type of school a student goes to.

One interesting algorithm to test with this dataset is the KNN alg to show:
        If given a certain data point, the algorithm would detect which school a student is 
        likely to attend. Eventually allowing the machine to determine which school a student
        attends and checking the accuracy of the machine afterwards. This could theoretically
        be used by school systems to determine zoning potentials based on a different type
        of quantitative data then they may currently use proving potentially successful
        
Another algorithm to test with the data is a decision tree in order to find specific correlations between commonalities in data.
    One way to use this algorithm would be to see if a student was Urban or Rural, then 
    check if their famsize if >3 or <3, and continue this trend until a specific conclusion is
    made that could then be used to generalize a certain group of the whole dataset.
    This in the end could be used as a way to say "If you are Urban, with a family of 5, and 
    your parents work as 'fill in the blank', you likely do 'fill in the blank'."
    
Hopefully through several different algorithms, we can come to many conclusions using comparison techniques on trends in the data. More specifically, one conclusion we hope to draw is: "As your student studies more hours, they are likely to have a lower amount of failed classes for the semester." Because we are given a data column with the number of classes a student has failed and a column showing the number of hours studied, this will be a fairly reliable set of data to compare to one another to receive the intended results. Again, since there are 33 columns, there are many types of conclusions that can be made using the different algorithms mentioned above.

Below is the list of attributes listed in the Students Dataset:

4 address - student's home address type (binary: 'U' - urban or 'R' - rural)
5 famsize - family size (binary: 'LE3' - less or equal to 3 or 'GT3' - greater than 3)
6 Pstatus - parent's cohabitation status (binary: 'T' - living together or 'A' - apart)
7 Medu - mother's education (numeric: 0 - none, 1 - primary education (4th grade), 2 â€“ 5th to 9th grade, 3 â€“ secondary education or 4 â€“ higher education)
8 Fedu - father's education (numeric: 0 - none, 1 - primary education (4th grade), 2 â€“ 5th to 9th grade, 3 â€“ secondary education or 4 â€“ higher education)
9 Mjob - mother's job (nominal: 'teacher', 'health' care related, civil 'services' (e.g. administrative or police), 'at_home' or 'other')

11 reason - reason to choose this school (nominal: close to 'home', school 'reputation', 'course' preference or 'other')
12 guardian - student's guardian (nominal: 'mother', 'father' or 'other')
13 traveltime - home to school travel time (numeric: 1 - <15 min., 2 - 15 to 30 min., 3 - 30 min. to 1 hour, or 4 - >1 hour)
14 studytime - weekly study time (numeric: 1 - <2 hours, 2 - 2 to 5 hours, 3 - 5 to 10 hours, or 4 - >10 hours)
15 failures - number of past class failures (numeric: n if 1<=n<3, else 4)
